# DSA-PROBLEMS-PATTERN-FARZ-INTERVIEW-SHEET

This repository contains my **pattern-wise Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) preparation** based on the **Fraz Interview Sheet**. The goal of this repo is to build strong problem‑solving fundamentals, improve interview performance, and prepare for **product-based companies**.

---

## 📌 Why this Repository?

Instead of solving random problems, this repo follows a **pattern-based approach**, which helps in:

* Identifying common problem patterns
* Building intuition to solve unseen problems
* Improving speed and confidence in interviews
* Reducing brute-force thinking

---

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Approach

For every problem, I follow this process:

1. Understand the problem and constraints
2. Identify the **DSA pattern** involved
3. Start with a brute-force solution (if applicable)
4. Optimize step-by-step
5. Write clean and readable code
6. Analyze **Time & Space Complexity**

---

## 🗂️ Patterns Covered

The problems are organized **pattern-wise** as follows:

* Arrays & Hashing
* Two Pointers
* Sliding Window
* Binary Search
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Linked List
* Stack & Queue
* Trees (DFS / BFS)
* Binary Search Trees (BST)
* Heaps / Priority Queue
* Greedy Algorithms
* Graphs
* Dynamic Programming
* Bit Manipulation

(Will keep updating as I progress 🚀)

---

## 💻 Language Used

* **Java** (Primary)

> Focus is on writing **interview-quality Java code** with proper structure and edge‑case handling.
